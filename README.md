# Calculator Project (Embedded C)

This project implements a basic calculator using Embedded C. It performs fundamental arithmetic operations and demonstrates structured programming, user input handling, and logical decision-making.

## 📌 Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- User input processing

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Embedded C
- Keil uVision (or any C compiler)
- 8051 microcontroller (optional hardware implementation)
- Proteus (simulation)

## ▶ How It Works

1. User selects an arithmetic operation.
2. Program accepts input numbers.
3. The selected operation is performed.
4. Result is displayed on both calculator and lcd.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Function-based programming
- Arithmetic logic implementation
- Code organization
- Embedded programming fundamentals

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Error handling for invalid operations
